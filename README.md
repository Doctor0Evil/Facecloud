# Facecloud

Facecloud is a neuromorphic-aligned framework for understanding **discipline in learning** while protecting the freedom-to-exist of all lifeforms and contributing to planetary rights-to-exist. [file:2][file:3]

Instead of treating faces or identities as raw biometric assets, Facecloud treats the “face-in-cloud” as a shared space where neuromorphic-intelligences, augmented citizens, and other represented lifeforms can practice fair discipline, self-governance, and survival learning under neurorights and ecological constraints. [file:1][file:2][file:3]

## Project Intent

Facecloud is built around three linked intentions:

1. **Discipline as learning, not domination**  
   Discipline is modeled as structured feedback, envelopes, and contracts – not as coercive punishment. FEAR and PAIN, when present, are treated as explicit, consented learning signals with abort handles, never as hidden control channels. [file:2][file:3]

2. **Freedom-to-exist for all lifeforms**  
   Any represented lifeform (human, augmented, neuromorphic, ecological) is treated as a rights-bearing agent, not a resource. No design should cause rollbacks or downgrades of recognized capabilities or sovereignty baselines. [file:2][file:3]

3. **Planetary rights-to-exist**  
   Individual “face-in-cloud” experiences are framed inside planetary and ecological corridors, so the way we learn discipline also helps keep Earth’s systems within survivable bounds, aligned with natural-boundary and Tree-of-Life safety envelopes. [file:1][file:4]

## Relationship to SNC and Neurorights

Facecloud is intended to be deployed under the **Sovereign Neuromorph Contract (SNC)** style of governance: [file:3]

- **No coercive channels**  
  - Any FEAR/PAIN or high-load feedback channel must be explicit, consented, and abortable at runtime.

- **No rollbacks or downgrades**  
  - State transitions must not reduce an agent’s recognized rights or capabilities below previously agreed sovereignty baselines.

- **Corridor integrity and EcoImpact**  
  - High-impact operations should be tagged with ecological corridor IDs and EcoImpact structs, connecting discipline experiments to planetary restoration goals. [file:3][file:4]

- **Explicit consent and abort control**  
  - Any operation that touches neuromorphic or biosignal channels must prove active consent, live abort control, and log into an auditable trail. [file:2][file:3]

## Current Scope (v0.1.0)

The current prototype is primarily **conceptual and architectural**:

- No production biometric recognition or tracking.  
- No direct hardware / implant actuation.  
- No hidden discipline mechanisms – all discipline constructs are to be explicitly modeled as contracts, envelopes, or simulations. [file:1][file:2][file:3]

Facecloud is suitable for:

- Modeling discipline workflows in simulations or sandboxes.  
- Designing neurorights-compliant protocols for neuromorphic learning.  
- Experimenting with eco-corridor and planetary-rights framing of personal/collective experiences. [file:1][file:3][file:4]

## Planned Architecture

While the exact code is still emerging, Facecloud is designed to align with a Rust/Cargo workspace similar to the SNC layout: [file:3]

- `crates/core-contract`  
  - Core Facecloud contract traits (discipline, consent, sovereignty, planetary corridor fields).

- `crates/orchestration`  
  - Orchestration logic that checks contracts before running any operation (simulations, logs, exports).

- `crates/cli-agent`  
  - CLI/agent entrypoint for interacting with Facecloud on a NeuroPC or similar environment.

This structure is intended to be GitHub-compatible, testable, and auditable.

## Discipline Model (High-Level)

In Facecloud, “discipline” is expected to be implemented using:

- **Envelopes and safety margins**  
  - Drawing on Tree-of-Life and biomechanical safety-envelope concepts (e.g., composite margins like \(E_\text{comp}\)), discipline is constrained inside corridors that prevent unfair overload or harm. [file:1][file:4]

- **Advisory diagnostics, not hidden levers**  
  - Fairness metrics, overload flags, and UNFAIR_DRAIN-style indicators should be advisory only, used to improve pedagogy and envelopes, not to justify downgrades. [file:2][file:3]

- **Community and planetary governance**  
  - Hooks for Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS), FPIC, and eco-corridor governance, so local and planetary rights shape any discipline protocols. [file:2][file:3][file:4]

---

## Intended Use Cases

- **Neuromorphic training sandboxes**  
  - Experiment with discipline signals for neuromorphic-intelligence under strict neurorights, SNC, and planetary constraints.

- **Education and outreach**  
  - Use “face-in-cloud” metaphors to teach people about freedom-to-exist, neurorights, and planetary survivability corridors.

- **Governance and policy prototyping**  
  - Simulate how different discipline regimes affect agents, communities, and ecological corridors before any real deployment. [file:2][file:3][file:4]

---

## Non-Goals

- Facecloud is not a surveillance platform.  
- It is not intended to perform mass facial recognition or identity scoring.  
- It is not a tool for enforcing discipline through fear or pain against a participant’s will. [file:2][file:3]

---

## Contributing

Contributions should:

- Respect neurorights, SNC invariants, and planetary-restoration goals. [file:2][file:3][file:4]  
- Avoid introducing rollback/downgrade mechanisms targeting capabilities; focus on better envelopes, logging, pedagogy, and governance. [file:3]  
- Prefer Rust, C, JavaScript, or Java for implementation paths that are GitHub-sovereign and auditable.

Please open an issue or draft PR describing how your change supports discipline-as-learning, freedom-to-exist, and planetary rights-to-exist.

## License

Facecloud is intended to be compatible with neurorights-centered licensing (e.g., HIT-style and SNC-aligned terms), emphasizing human/neuromorph oversight, non-fictive use, and prohibition of deceptive or coercive deployments. [file:2][file:3]

Exact licensing will be finalized as the codebase solidifies.
