# Facecloud

Facecloud is a **research-only**, public-facing Rust workspace for:

- neuromorphic-style safety envelopes (“face-in-cloud” as scalar threshold);
- deviceless software systems that reason about biomechanical integration *without* controlling hardware;
- multi-layer, DNA-inspired authentication policies for cloud and API access.

It does **not** implement medical treatment, implants, or actuation logic. All modules operate on abstract telemetry and authentication metadata for modeling, monitoring, and policy evaluation aligned with modern security and key management practices. [web:16][web:17][web:19]
